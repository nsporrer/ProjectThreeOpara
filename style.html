            <p>He states the Margaret Thatcher contributed to his desire to become a designer, Thatcher took away school
                children's milk and Opara claimed to have loved milk and he wanted to be part of a movement that “gave
                back and collaborated for the common good.” He knows it's strange, but he says childhood impressions are
                very powerful and that moment really stuck with him and shaped his attitude.</p>

            <p>During his academic studies he moved to Holland for one year, where he was blown away at how integrated
                their design was into their life. And his over style of work seems to be heavily influenced by the Dutch
                design style</p>

            <p>I would say Eddie’s signature style I very clean and minimalistic, He isn't adding anything to the
                designs that isn't necessary.</p>
