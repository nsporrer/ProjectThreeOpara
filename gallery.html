            and made sure the name was still visible from all angles. He also created some environmental graphics
            for the museum such as the G seen here.</p>

            <h3>Wordmark &amp; Branding for Baffler Magazine</h3>
            <p>Opara re-designed the American cultural, political, and business analysis magazine. He incorporated a
                backwards L which allows the wordmark to be altered and placed into the corner. He also made an
                animation of the wordmark transitioning between the two.</p>
